## Introduction

Olptik is a powerful web scraping and data extraction platform that helps you gather and process web data efficiently. You can get started with Olptik in two ways:

1. Using our Node SDK
2. Using our REST API directly

## Getting Started with the API

### Authentication

First, you'll need an API key. You can get one from your [dashboard](https://app.olptik.com/0/settings/crawl). Include it in your requests using the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
```

### Create Your First Crawl

Start by creating a crawl with your target URL:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript javascript
// npm i olyptik

import Olptik = from "olyptik";

const client = new Olptik({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

const crawl = await client.createCrawl({
    startUrl: 'https://example.com',
    maxResults: 10
  });
  
console.log('Crawl created:', crawl.id);
```

```python python
from olyptik import Olyptik

client = Olyptik(api_key='your-api-key')

def create_crawl():
    crawl = client.create_crawl(
        startUrl= 'https://example.com',
        maxResults= 10
    )
    
    print('Crawl created:', crawl.id)
    return crawl
```

```bash curl
curl -X POST https://api.olptik.com/v1/crawls \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startUrl": "https://example.com",
    "maxResults": 10
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

The response will include a `crawl_id` that you'll use to track and retrieve results:

```json
{
  "id": "crawl_123",
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2024-03-21T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Monitor Crawl Status

You have two options to track your crawl's progress:

1. **Poll the Status** (Simple approach):

<CodeGroup>

```javascript javascript
async function getCrawlStatus(crawlId) {
  const status = await client.getCrawl(crawlId);
  console.log('Crawl status:', status);
  return status;
}
```

```python python
def get_crawl_status(crawl_id):
    status = client.get_crawl(crawl_id)
    print('Crawl status:', status)
    return status
```

```bash curl
curl https://api.olptik.com/v1/crawls/{crawl_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here"
```

</CodeGroup>

2. **Webhook Notifications**:
Configure a webhook URL in your dashboard to receive real-time status updates:

```json
{
  "event": "crawl.status_changed",
  "data": {
    "crawl_id": "crawl_123",
    "status": "completed",
    "timestamp": "2024-03-21T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Get Crawl Results

Once the crawl is complete, retrieve the results:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript javascript
async function getCrawlResults(crawlId) {
  const results = await client.getCrawlResults(crawlId);
  console.log('Crawl results:', results);
  return results;
}
```

```python python
def get_crawl_results(crawl_id):
    results = client.get_crawl_results(crawl_id)
    print('Crawl results:', results)
    return results
```

```bash curl
curl https://api.olptik.com/v1/crawls/{crawl_id}/results \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here"
```

</CodeGroup>

Example response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "title": "Example Domain",
    "description": "This domain is for use in examples."
  },
  "metadata": {
    "crawled_at": "2024-03-21T10:00:00Z",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```
