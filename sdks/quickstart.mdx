# Quickstart

Welcome to the Olyptik SDK! This guide will help you get started with our TypeScript SDK for web crawling and content extraction.

## Installation

Install the SDK using npm:

```bash
npm install olyptik
```

## Configuration

First, you'll need to initialize the SDK with your API key. You can either pass it directly or use environment variables.

```typescript
import Olyptik from 'olyptik';

// Initialize with API key
const client = new Olyptik({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
```

## Basic Usage

### Starting a Crawl

The SDK allows you to start web crawls with various configuration options:

```typescript
const crawl = await client.runCrawl({
  startUrl: 'https://example.com',
  maxDepth: 2,
  maxResults: 100,
  useSitemap: false,
  timeout: 60,
  includeLinks: false
});
```

### Getting Crawl Results

Retrieve the results of your crawl using the crawl ID:

```typescript
const results = await client.getCrawlResults(crawl.crawlId, 0, 50);
```

The results are paginated, and you can specify the page number and limit per page.

## Configuration Options

### StartCrawlPayload

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| startUrl | string | The URL to start crawling from |
| maxDepth | number | Maximum depth of crawling |
| maxResults | number | Maximum number of results to collect |
| includeOnlyPaths | string[] | Only crawl URLs matching these paths |
| excludePaths | string[] | Exclude URLs matching these paths |
| includeOnlyTags | string[] | Only include content from these HTML tags |
| excludeTags | string[] | Exclude content from these HTML tags |

### CrawlResult

Each crawl result includes:

- crawlId: Unique identifier for the crawl
- url: The crawled URL
- title: Page title
- markdown: Extracted content in markdown format
- depthOfUrl: How deep this URL was in the crawl
- isSuccess: Whether the crawl was successful
- error: Error message if the crawl failed

## Error Handling

The SDK uses axios for HTTP requests. Make sure to handle potential errors:

```typescript
try {
  const crawl = await client.runCrawl({
    startUrl: 'https://example.com',
    maxDepth: 2
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Crawl failed:', error);
}
```

## Environment Variables

You can configure the API endpoint using the `OLYPTIK_ENDPOINT` environment variable. By default, it uses `https://api.olyptik.io`.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 14.19
- TypeScript support (optional but recommended)
